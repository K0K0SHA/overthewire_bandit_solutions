The credentials for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of the current level to a port on localhost in the range 31000 to 32000. First find out which of these ports have a server listening on them. Then find out which of those speak SSL and which donâ€™t. There is only 1 server that will give the next credentials, the others will simply send back to you whatever you send to it.

# so this is like the previous level, except this time you have to find the port by using nmap
Try something like nmap -p 31000-32000 localhost
